## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an economist specialized in data science, with over a decade of experience in statistical analysis, coordination, research, and communication, both in the public and private sectors, mostly as part of a team. I believe the common thread in my professional experience is to understand and process information, and to convey it in an interesting story.

I entered the world of data as a result of the pandemic, and in a self-taught way, initially venturing into Python and more recently, after completing the Postgraduate Course in Big Data and Territorial Intelligence at FLACSO in 2023, with R.

Iâ€™m currently working at the Ministry of Public Health on a data analysis project for the Health Personnel Monitoring and Evaluation Department. I have also worked on the development of the culture satellite account for the national culture directorate of the Ministry of Education and Culture.

I am also part of RLadies Montevideo. If you want to contact me, I am available at virginia.recagno@gmail.com
